# PakPal
**Rename, manage, repack and export lots of images at once** inside Blender all in the same place.

This is a small tool I made to fill a specific workflow need when working on VR environments so I don't plan on updating it much, so keep that in mind.

### Features
- **Batch export any number of loaded images with one click**.
- Visualize sets of material images as bundles grouped by their material slot names.  
- Batch rename and delete image bundles and selected image sets.
- **Automatically pack material slots into new images**, with support for custom presets and flexible material slot identification.
- Create reusable Export Locations with automatic timestamp support.

## Whats currently missing?
- **Custom Image Formatting** - Image Packing currently defaults to .png and it shouldn't, but I need to figure out how best to implement custom image formatting before adding it.
- **Folder Tags for Bundles** - Being able to create folders for textures that belong in a bundle would be nice, but I haven't added it yet ðŸ™Š

## Why didn't you add this functionality to Capsule?
Because it doesn't fit anywhere nicely in Capsule.  One of my important goals for Capsule is to keep it as focused and unbloated as possible - a problem many addons fall into where they end up trying to solve too many diverse problems.  

This addon happily works alongside Capsule without issue.
