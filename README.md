# Pak
Pak is a simple tool for batch exporting image files from Blender.  Have a bunch of images in a scene you want to be anywhere but Blender?  Use this :ok_hand:

This is a small tool I made to fill a specific workflow need when working on environments and so I don't plan on updating it much, it's a simple tool for a simple job.

### Features
- Batch exporting of any image loaded in a .blend file.
- See images as bundles grouped by their texture slot names, and rename bundles together.
- Automated Image Packing (soon(tm)).
- File Path Presets and Tags.

## Why didn't you add this functionality to Capsule?
Because it doesn't fit anywhere nicely in Capsule.  One of my important goals for Capsule is to keep it as focused and unbloated as possible - a problem many addons fall into where they end up trying to solve too many diverse problems.  

This addon happily works alongside Capsule without issue.
