# PakPal
PakPal is a simple tool for batch exporting image files from Blender.  Have a bunch of images in a scene you want to be anywhere but Blender?  Use this :ok_hand:

This is a small tool I made to fill a specific workflow need when working on environments and so I don't plan on updating it much, it's a simple tool for a simple job.

### Features
- **Batch export any number of loaded images with one click**.
- Visualize sets of material images as bundles grouped by their material slot names.  Includes the ability to quickly rename image bundles all at once.
- **Automatically pack material slots into new images**, with support for custom presets and flexible material slot identification.
- Create reusable Export Locations with automatic timestamp support.

## Whats currently missing?
- **Custom Image Formatting** - Image Packing currently defaults to .png and it shouldn't, but I need to figure out how best to implement custom image formatting before adding it.

## Why didn't you add this functionality to Capsule?
Because it doesn't fit anywhere nicely in Capsule.  One of my important goals for Capsule is to keep it as focused and unbloated as possible - a problem many addons fall into where they end up trying to solve too many diverse problems.  

This addon happily works alongside Capsule without issue.
