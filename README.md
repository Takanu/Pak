# PakPal
**Browse, rename, manage, repack and export lots of images all at once,** inside Blender all in the same place.

This is a small tool I made to fill a specific workflow need when working on VR environments so I don't plan on updating it much, so keep that in mind.

### Features
- Browse, edit and preview all loaded images from one place (Properties > Output).
- **Batch export any number of loaded images with one click**.
- Visualize sets of material images as bundles grouped by their material slot names.  
- Batch rename and delete image bundles with multiselection support.
- **Automatically pack material slots into new images**, with support for custom presets, image format options and flexible material slot identification.
- Repack images from material image sets, includes batch repacking and flexible material slot name identification.
- Define custom material slot names for PakPal's bundling and image repacking features.


## Why didn't you add this functionality to Capsule?
Because it doesn't fit anywhere nicely in Capsule.  One of my important goals for Capsule is to keep it as focused and unbloated as possible - a problem many addons fall into where they end up trying to solve too many diverse problems.  

This addon happily works alongside Capsule without issue.
